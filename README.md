# Rotary-Parking-System-Model-with-Path-Algorithm
A functional small scale rotary parking system that works with model cars. The algorithm choses the most efficient path for switching parking spots.
There are two codes for two different Arduino UNO R3's that are communicating with each other via RX/TX pins.
